-- Linear regression â€” use to predict a numeric value
-- The model is used to predict the combined three point field goal attempts based on the previous game statistics

--#0 - Dataset and Tables
-- CREATE a BigQuery dataset in the BQ console named 'bqml_tutorial' in 'US'
-- CREATE two tables by copying `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_teams_games_sr` as `cume_games` & 'wide_games'

-- #1 - Create and Train
-- NOTES: must convert or remove TIMESTAMP columns, must replace NULL with 0 for label column
